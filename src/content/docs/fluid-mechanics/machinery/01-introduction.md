Learning about machines that transfer energy between its operating parts and a
fluid.

Examples:

- [Pumps](/fluid-mechanics/machinery/pumps)
- Blowers
- Compressors
- [Turbines](/fluid-mechanics/machinery/turbines)

## Classification

### Based on energy transfer direction

#### Machine to Fluid

Examples:

- Pumps (for liquids)
- Blowers, Compressors (for gases)

#### Fluid to Machine

Examples:

- Fluid motors
- Turbines

#### Fluid only as a energy transfer medium

Examples:

- Hydraulic Jack

### Based on principle of operation

#### Positive displacement

Fluid taken into an enclosed space and forced out by repeated mechanical action.

Examples:

- Piston pump
- Rotary pump

:::note

In piston pump (slider-crank mechanism), the movement of the piston is called as
"reciprocating action".

:::

#### Rotodynamic

Main component is a rotating element. It rotates inside a fluid. Rotating
element's kinetic energy is transferred to fluid when the fluid flwos through
it.

| Machine      | Main rotating element |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Pumps        | Impeller              |
| Turbines     | Runner                |
| Fans/Blowers | Rotor                 |

### Summary

|                        | Machine to Fluid         | Fluid to Machine | Fluid as a energy transfer medium    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Positive Displacementd | Piston pump, Rotary pump | Motors           | Hydraulic Ram, Jack Press            |
| Rotodynamic            | Pumps, Compressors       | Turbines         | Hydraulic coupling, Torque converter |

:::note

In s1, only rotodynamic [pumps](/fluid-mechanics/machinery/pumps) and
rotodynamic turbines are studied.
