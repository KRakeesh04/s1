Most used pumps in engineering because they support wide range of heights and
flow rates. Mixed flow, rotodynamic pump.

There can be a diffuser as well, which is optional.

### Volute

Casing of the impeller. A passage with increasing area, to reduce velocity (to
reduce losses).

:::note

Energy losses in a fluid flow is directly proportional to $v^2$. $ $

:::

### Diffuser

A fixed set of vanes added to the impeller. To direct the flow into the volute,
to minimize impact losses.

## Operation

- Volute must be filled with fluid to start pumping
- Fluid enters through the _eye_ of the impeller
- $v$ and $P$ are increased when the fluid flows through the impeller
