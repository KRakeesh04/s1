When a fluid-contained vessel moves with a constant acceleration it will be
transmitted to the fluid. The fluid particles will move to a new position and
remain in such position in equilibrium, relative to the vessel. Such equilibrium
is known as the Relative Equilibrium of a fluid.

## Relative Equilibrium under linear acceleration

No flow of the fluid (relative to the fluid particles). No shear forces, and all
forces are normal to the surface they act on. Hence, fluid statics equations can
be used in relative equilibrium.

### Variation of pressure

Let $P=f(x,y,z)$. $ $

```math
\text{d}p
=
\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}}\text{d}x
+
\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}}\text{d}y
+
\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{z}}\text{d}z
```

Consider the fluid element containing point $A$ which is under an acceleration
of $a_x,a_y,a_z$ in the $x,y,z$ directions.

By applying Newton's second law of motion in all 3 directions:

$\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}}=-\rho a_x\;\land\;\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}}=-\rho a_y$

$\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{z}}=-\rho(a_z+g)$

Substituting all the terms:

```math
\text{d}p
=
-\rho a_x\text{d}x
-\rho a_y\text{d}y
-\rho (a_z+g)\text{d}z
```

Integrating both sides:

```math
P=
-\rho a_x x
-\rho a_y y
-\rho (a_z+g) z
+c_1
```

### Shape of free surface

On the free surface $P=0$ because gauge pressure is considered. $ $

```math
\rho a_x x
+\rho a_y y
+\rho (a_z+g) z
=c_1
```

Free surface is a plane surface in 3D.

### Inclination with horizontal plane

Let a vessel be in acceleration in $a_x,a_z$ in $x,z$ directions. $a_y=0$.

If $\theta_x,\theta_y$ are the angles in $x,y$ directions.

```math
\tan{(\theta_x)}=
\frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}x}
\;\land\;
\tan{(\theta_y)}=
\frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}y}
```

Differentiating the equation of the free surface with respect to $x$. $ $

```math
\rho a_x
+\rho (a_z+g) \frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}x}
=0
\implies
\tan{(\theta_x)}=\frac{-a_x}{a_z+g}
```

```math
\rho a_y
+\rho (a_z+g) \frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}y}
=0
\implies
\tan{(\theta_y)}=\frac{-a_y}{a_z+g}
```

## Relative Equilibrium Types

### Under Horizontal Acceleration

$a_x\neq 0\;\land\;a_y=a_z=0$

#### Equation of the free surface

```math
\rho a_x x
+\rho g z
=c_1
```

Is a straight line in $x, z$ axes. The straight line is at an inclination of
$\theta_x$:

```math
\tan{(\theta_x)}=\frac{-a_x}{g}
```

#### Vertical Pressure Distribution

Varies only in $z$ direction. Increases with height. Isobars are horizontal. $ $

### Under Vertical Acceleration

$a_z\neq 0\;\land\;a_x=a_y=0$

#### Equation of the free surface

```math
\rho (a_z+g) z=c_1
```

Horizontal straight line.

#### Vertical Pressure Distribution

![vertical-acceleration-vertical-pressure-variation](/fluids/vertical-acceleration-vertical-pressure-variation.jpg)

$P_1=-\rho(a_z+g)z_1+c_1$

$P_2=-\rho(a_z+g)z_2+c_1$

$P_2-P_1=-\rho(a_z+g)(z_2-z_1)$

$P_2=h\rho(a_z+g)$

Here:

- $h\rho g$ - hydrostatic pressure
- $h\rho a_z$ - due to $a_z$

Varies only in $z$ direction. Increases with height. Isobars are horizontal. $ $
