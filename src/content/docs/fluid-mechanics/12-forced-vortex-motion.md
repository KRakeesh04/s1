If a fluid-contained vessel is rotating at a constant angular velocity, the
fluid will reach a relative equilibrium position and rotate with the vessel.
Under this condition, the fluid is said to be in Forced Vortex Motion.

:::note

For S1, forced vortex motion, only about vertical axis, is required.
