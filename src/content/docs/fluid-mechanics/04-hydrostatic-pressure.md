![Pressure Definition](/CE1023/pressure-definition.png)

At a point,

```math
P = \lim_{\delta A \to 0} \frac{\delta F}{\delta A}
```

## Characteristics

### Pascal's law

The hydrostatic pressure at a point is the same from all directions. Applies
only for hydrostatic pressure.

#### Proof

### Variation along directions

#### Proof

## Piezometric pressure

$ P = -\rho gz + c $

```math
P + \rho gz = c = P^{*}
```

## Pressure difference between 2 points

![Pressure difference](/CE1023/pressure-difference.png)

$ P_1 = -\rho gz_1 + c $

$ P_2 = -\rho gz_2 + c $

$ P_2 - P_1 = -\rho g(z_2 - z_1) = -\rho g (-h) = h \rho g $

$ P_2 = P_1 + h \rho g $

In a homogenous, incompressible fluid in equilibrium:

1. Piezometric pressure is constant throughout the fluid
2. Pressure varies linearly with depth only
3. Isobars (surface of constant pressure) are horizontal.
