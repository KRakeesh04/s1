Thrust exerted on a submerged object in a liquid. Direction is vertically
upwards. Line of action passes through center of buoyancy.

$u=\text{weight of the fluid volume displaced}=v\rho{g}$

Here:

- $u$ - the upthrust
- $v$ - the submerged volume
- $\rho$ - density of the fluid

## Center of buoyancy

Center of gravity of the displaced fluid volume. _NOT_ the center of gravity of
the submerged object.

## Proof

Forces exerted on the submerged object is equivalent to forces exerted on the
displaced volume before it was displaced.

Consider the equilibrium of displaced volume before it was displaced:

$\text{Weight}=W=\text{Resultant force exerted by surrounding liquid}=F$

$F$ must be equal to $W$, opposite to $W$ and acts through $G$ of the considered
volume of fluid.
