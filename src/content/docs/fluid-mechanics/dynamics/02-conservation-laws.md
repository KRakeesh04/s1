In fluid dynamics, 4 laws are used to analyse the fluid flow.

- Laws of mechanics
- Conservation of mass
- Conservation of energy
- Conservation of momentum

These laws are applied to a specific volume of the fluid in motion, and it's
called as control volume.

## Control volume

A volume, through which a fluid flows.

- It's a fixed volume
- Can either be real or imaginary

## Conservation of mass

Mass cannot be created nor destroyed.

## Conservation of energy

Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but can be converted from one form to
another.

## Conservation of momentum

Unless a resultant force is exerted on a mass, it cannot gain or lose momentum.

### Momentum

```math
M = \text{mass}\times\text{velocity}= mv
```
