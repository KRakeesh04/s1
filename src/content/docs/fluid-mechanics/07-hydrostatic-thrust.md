title: Hydrostatic Thrust
---

## On a Plane Surface

$ \text{Thrust} = \text{submerged area} \times P_G $

$G$ is the centroid of the submerged area. $P_G$ is the pressure at the
centroid.

Acts normal to the surface on the point on the surface known as **the Centre of
Pressure**.

### Centre of Pressure

```math
y_c = y_G + \frac{I_{\text{GG}}}{A\cdot y_G}
```

Here:

- $A$ - Total submerged area
- $y_c$ - Distance to centre of pressure measured along the submerged surface
  from the free surface
- $y_G$ - Distance to $G$ measured along the submerged surface from the free
  surface
- $I_{\text{GG}}$ - Second moment of submerged area about the centroidal surface
  parallel to the free surface

:::note[For a plane surface]

$ \frac{\text{Hydrostatic thrust}}{\text{Unit length}} = \text{Area of the
pressure diagram} $
