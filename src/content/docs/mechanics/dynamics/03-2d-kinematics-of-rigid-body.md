### Rigid body

A solid body that doesn't deforms.

### Degrees of freedom

In the motion of a rigid body in 2D kinematics, there are 3 degrees of freedom.

- Movement along $x$ direction
- Movement along $y$ direction
- Rotation about $z$ direction

In 3D, there are 6 degrees of freedom: movement and rotation along each
direction.

## General 2D motion

```math
v_B=v_A+\dot{\theta}\times r_{B/A}
```

```math
a_B=a_A+\ddot{\theta}\times r_{B/A}+\dot{\theta}\times (\dot{\theta}\times r_{B/A})
```

### Instantaneous centre of rotation

The point that has zero velocity at a particular instant of time. This point
might be changing throughout the motion.

:::note

It can be imagined that the object is momentarily having a pure rotation about
this centre $I$. $ $

### Centrode

The locus of instantaneous centres during the motion.
