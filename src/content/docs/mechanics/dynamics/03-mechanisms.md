### Mechanism

An assembly of rigid bodies or links designed to obtain a desired motion from an
available motion while transmitting appropriate forces and moments. Motion of
the links have definite relative motion with other links.

#### Simple mechanisms

- Lever
- Pulley
- Gear trains
- Belt and chain drive
- Four bar linkage

#### Other complex mechanisms

- Lock stitch mechanism (used in sewing machine)
- Geneva mechanism  
  Constant rotational motion to intermittent rotational motion. mostly used in
  watches.
- Scotch yoke mechanism  
  Constant rotational motion to linear motion (vice versa.). Mainly used as
  valve actuators in high pressure gas pipelines.
- Slider crank mechanism  
  Used in internal combustion engines

## 2D link mechanisms

### Method of instantaneous centre of rotation

- Find the instantaneous centre of the rotation from known velocities at known
  points
- Use the instantaneous centre to find velocities at other points

### Kinematic chain

An arbitrary collection of links (forming a closed link) that is capable of
relative motion and that can be made into a rigid structure by an additional
single link.
