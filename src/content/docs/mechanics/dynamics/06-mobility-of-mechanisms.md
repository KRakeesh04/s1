## Grubler's Equation

A rigid body is constrained by a lower pair, which allows only rotational or
sliding movement. It has one degree of freedom, and the two degrees of freedom
are lost.

When a rigid body is constrained by a higher pair, it has two degrees of
freedom: translating along the curved surface and turning about the
instantaneous contact point.

- $N$ - number of kinematic elements
- $L$ - number of lower pairs
- $H$ - number of higher pairs

```math
F=3(N-1)-2L-H=1 \implies 3N-2L+H=4
```
