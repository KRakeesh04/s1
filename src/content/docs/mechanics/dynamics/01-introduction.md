## Mechanism

An assembly of machine components (kinematic links) designed to obtain a desired
motion from an available motion while transmitting appropriate forces and
moments.

## Simple mechanisms

- Lever
- Pulley
- Gear trains
- Belt and chain drive
- Four bar linkage

## Other mechanisms

- Lock stitch mechanism (used in sewing machine)
- Geneva mechanism  
  Constant rotational motion to intermittent rotational motion. mostly used in
  watches.
- Scotch yoke mechanism  
  Constant rotational motion to linear motion (vice versa.). Mainly used as
  valve actuators in high pressure gas pipelines.
