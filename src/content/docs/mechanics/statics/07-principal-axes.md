The product of moment of area is zero about principal axes.

```math
I_{xy} = 0
```

There will be 2 directions of principal axes which are perpendicular to each
other.

Any axis of symmetry is a principal axis. Any axis through centroid is a
principal axis.

## Principal second moments of area

Second moments about the principal axes.

About principal axes second moments of area will be at minimum and maximum.

## Centroidal principal axes

Principal axes through the centroid.
