Deviations from the ideal in real trusses

- Loads are not applied only at joints; hence there is bending in members
- Joints are not perfectly pinned, so moments can be developed at joints

## Method of Joints

### Principle

Since the truss is in equilibrium, each pin joint must be in equilibrium.

:::note

2 equilibrium equations can be written at each joint â€“ vertical & horizontal

:::

### Sign convention

Tensile forces are positive. Compressive forces are negative.

### Method

- Find external reactions using equilibrium using equilibrium equations for the
  entire truss.
- Start with a joint with only 2 unknown joint forces.
- Mark the tensile forces (consider all forces are tensile) acting on the join.
- Find the unknown forces at the selected joint, using 2 equilibrium equations
  for the joint.
- Go to all other joints in turn and find forces in all the members.
