- long ($L >> B,D$)
- axis of the beam is straight
- constant cross-section throughout its length

## Classified by supporting conditions

## At a section

![At a section](/mechanics/at-a-section.png)

- $ P $ - Normal force / Axial force
- $ S_y, S_y $ - Shear forces along $y$ and $z$ axis
- $ M_x $ - Twisting moment / Torque
- $ M_y, M_z $ - Bending moments about $y$ and $z$ axis

## Degress of freedom

A plane member have 3 degress of freedom. Any of the 3 can be restrained.

- Displacement in x-direction
- Displacement in y-direction
- Rotation about z-direction

## Sign convention

- Bending moment
  - Hogging (curves upwards) is **(+)ve**
  - Sagging (curves downwards) is **(-)ve**
- Shear force
  - Clockwise shear is **(+)ve**.
  - Counterclockwise shear is **(-)ve**.
