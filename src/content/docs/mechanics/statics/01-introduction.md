## Centroid / Centre of area

The point where the area of a figure is assumed to be concentrated.

Located on the axes of symmetry.

## First moment of area

```math
\text{About x-axis} = \int_A {y \text{d}A}
```

```math
\text{About y-axis} = \int_A {x \text{d}A}
```

## Second moment of area

```math
\text{About x-axis} = I_{xx} = I_x = \int_A {y^2 \text{d}A}
```

```math
\text{About y-axis} = I_{yy} = I_y = \int_A {x^2 \text{d}A}
```

## The product of moment of area about x,y axes

```math
I_{xy} = \int_A {xy \text{d}A}
```

## The polar moment of area about z axis

```math
I_{zz} = J_0 = \int_A {r^2 \text{d}A} = I_{xx} + I_{yy}
```

## Radius of gyration

```math
\text{About x-axis} = r_x^2 = \frac{I_{xx}}{A}
```

```math
\text{About y-axis} = r_y^2 = \frac{I_{yy}}{A}
```

```math
\text{About z-axis} = r_z^2 = \frac{I_{zz}}{A}
```
