3 types

- Bars (1D)
- Plates and Shells (2D)
- Blocks (3D)

Bar elements are only focused for 1st semester.

## Pin Joint

Doesn't exert a moment. Free rotations are allowed. When only pin joints are
used, bars will have only axial forces.

## Bars

![Axes in a bar](/mechanics/bar-axes.jpg)

Here

- $N$ - Axial force
- $S_x,S_y$ - Shear force
- $M_x$

### Types of bars

#### Axially loaded

Generally in trusses, **pin joints** are considered.

- Predominant tension - Ties
- Predominant compression - Struts

#### Flexural

- Predominant bending - beams

#### Torsional

- Predominant torque - shafts
