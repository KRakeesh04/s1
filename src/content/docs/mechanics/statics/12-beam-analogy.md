In this method, the internal forces are found assuming the elongated truss is a
beam.

:::note[For a simply supported beam]

- Maximum bending moment is at mid-span: $M_{\text{max}}=\frac{wL^2}{8}$
- Maximum shear force is at the supports: $\frac{wL}{2}$

![Beam analogy for a truss](/mechanics/beam-analogy.jpg)

Here:

- Chord members - horizontal members
- Web members - diagonal members
- $d$ - truss depth

In the truss,

- Bending moment is carried by chord members.  
  $\text{Bending moment}=F_{\text{chord}}\times d$
- Shear force is carried by vertical component of web member force

:::note[Pratt & Howe type trusses]

**Pratt type truss** is shown below.

![Pratt type truss](/mechanics/pratt-type-truss.jpg)

Internal force in web members are tensile.

**Howe type truss** is a shown below.

![Howe type truss](/mechanics/howe-type-truss.jpg)

Internal force in web members are compressive.

Usually **Pratt type** is cost-efficient. To make sure a howe type truss is
strong enough like pratt type, web members must be shorter and thicker.
