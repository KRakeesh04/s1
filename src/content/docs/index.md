title: What's this?
---

It's a website of my short notes.

## Why?

- Exercise books are not indexable.
- Searching in exercise books takes more time.

## Included subjects

Currently includes WIP notes for these subjects:

- MT1023 Properties of Materials
- CE1023 Fluid Mechanics
- EE1040 Electrical Fundamentals

These subjects are hard to be kept in a website. However, I am trying to include
some details on them.

- MA1014 Mathematics
- CS1033 Programming Fundamentals
- ME1033 Mechanics

Just no.

- EL1030 Language Skills Enhancement
