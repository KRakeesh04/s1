The programs are listed in no specific order.

TODO: sort these in easy-to-hard order.

1. **length of last word**: Given a string s consisting of words and spaces,
   return the length of the last word in the string.
2. **prime**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and outputs whether its a
   [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) or not.
3. **n-th factorial**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and outputs n-th
   [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).
4. **perfect number**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and outputs whether
   its a [perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number).
5. **fibonacci number**: A program that takes in a number $n$ and prints all
   [fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) less
   than or equal to $n$.
6. **binary addition**: Take in 2 numbers in binary (as strings) and output the
   sum of both numbers. Try not to use `bin` function.
7. **big integer addition**: Given _a very large integer_ represented as a list,
   where each `digits[i]` is the $i^{\text{th}}$ digit of the integer. The
   digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in
   left-to-right order. Increment the large integer by one and return the
   resulting array of digits. Don't construct a `int` object.
8. **determinant of matrix**: Take in a matrix from user. Output the determinant
   of the matrix. First try for $2\times 2$. Then go higher-ordered matrices.
9. **pascal's triangle**: Take $n$ from user input. Print
   [pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) to $n$
   rows.
10. **is valid palindrome**: Take a string input from user. Output if phrase is
    palindrome or not. A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all
    uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric
    characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters
    include letters and numbers.
11. **armstrong numbers**: Take $n$ from user input. Print all
    [armstrong numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) (in
    base 10, of course) between 0 and $n$ (inclusive).
