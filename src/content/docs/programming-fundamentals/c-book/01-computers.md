An electronic device for analyzing and storing data, making calculations, etc.

Originates from the word compute which means calculate. Computers can be
programmed to process data following some finite set of instructions.

## Types of computers

### Personal computers

Or PCs in short. Intended to be used by a single person. First introduced by
IBM. Built around a family of microprocessors referred to as "8086"
(manufactured by Intel). Therefore its structure is referred to as "x86
architecture".

An alternate system was Macintosh (introduced by Apply). Due to differences in
hardware architecture between x86 and Macintosh, software used by these systems
were not portable to the other.

Types of personal computers:

- Desktop - designed to sit on or under a desk. too big to be carried around.
- Workstation - desktop computers with high specs. powerful. built for
  specialized use cases.
- Laptop - portable. categorized under mobile computers.
- Tablet - even lighter than laptops. include touch input support.
- Handheld - can fit in our hands. example: personal digital assistant.
- Smartphone - cellular phones with advanced features
- Wearable - can be worn such as glasses

### Network servers

Powerful personal computers with special hardware and software that enable them
to function as primary computers in a network. They may be setup in groups
called clusters or server farms.

### Mainframe computers

Used in large organizations where many people, even thousands, frequently need
to access the same data. Traditionally, each user accesses a mainframe computer
through a device called a terminal.

### Minicomputers

More powerful than personal computers but less powerful compared to mainframes.
Aka. midrange computers.

### Supercomputers

Most powerful, physically largest computers. Have thousands of processors.

### Embedded computers

Computers that reside in a device and not directly visible. Aka. invisible
computers. These devices are referred to as _smart_ because they can interact
with the environment in a more intelligent, adaptive, and efficient way.

## Components of a computer system

A computer is a system. A complete computer system consists of:

- [Hardware](/programming-fundamentals/c-book/computer-hardware/): Tangible
  elements that can be seen and touched
- [Software](/programming-fundamentals/c-book/computer-software/): Programs that
  allow users to use the computer system and control its activities. Not
  tangible.
- Data: Individual facts or pieces of information that is input to the computer
  for processing or produces as output after processing.
- User(s)

## Information

Computers can process various types of data. When a communication link (such as
Internet) is provided, the data can be transferred to other users despite of
distance. The computer and communication technologies that made this possible
are together referred to as information technology or IT (or, sometimes as
information and communication technology or ICT). Computers are therefore at the
heart of IT.

An information system is a system with well-defined procedures and techniques to
collect, store, process, and disseminate information.
