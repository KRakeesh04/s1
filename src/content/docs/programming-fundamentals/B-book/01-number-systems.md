A writing system for expressing numbers. Each number system defines a set of
symbols that each represent a specific value.

### Base (or radix)

Number of symbols defined by a number system.

## Commonly used number systems

- Base 10 - $0\text{ - }9$
- Base 2 - $0,1$
- Base 8 - $0\text{ - }7$
- Base 16 - $0\text{ - }9, \text{A - F}$

:::caution

These are required for s1:

- Converting integers and floats between number systems
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division in base 2

But I don't know how to include it in a easy-to-understand way. 🌝
