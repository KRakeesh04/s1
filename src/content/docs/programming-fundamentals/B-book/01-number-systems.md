A writing system for expressing numbers. Each number system defines a set of
symbols that each represent a specific value.

### Base (or radix)

Number of symbols defined by a number system.

## Commonly used number systems

- Base 10 - $0\text{ - }9$
- Base 2 - $0,1$
- Base 8 - $0\text{ - }7$
- Base 16 - $0\text{ - }9, \text{A - F}$

:::caution

These are required for s1:

- Converting integers and floats between number systems
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division in base 2

But I don't know how to include it in a easy-to-understand way. üåù

:::note[Confusion about unit prefixes]

In computing, the prefix _kilo_ ‚Äîjust like other prefixes‚Äî has been used to
refer either $2^{10}$ or $10^3$ depending on the context.

- $10^3$ - Marketing of disk capacities (by disk manufacturers)
- $2^{10}$ - Memory capacities, and file sizes, disk capacities by operating
  systems

To avoid this confusion, 2 unit prefixes are used while measuring amounts of
data.

- SI prefixes Defined by ISO. Based on powers of $10^3$. Examples: kilo, mega,
  giga.
- Binary prefixes Defined by IEC. Based on powers of $2^{10}$. Examples: kibi,
  mebi, gibi.
