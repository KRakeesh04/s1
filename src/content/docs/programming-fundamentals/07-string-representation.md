A way of representing non-numerical data.

## Commonly used encodings

### ASCII

Abbreviation for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Uses 7 bits
for letter representation and a parity bit (MSB). Can represent latin alphabet,
digits, punctuations, and control characters.

Major limitation in ASCII is it can't support multiple languages.

### Unicode

Uses 32 bits. Supports multiple languages and emojis. Characters are presented
by code points. A code point is a integer (in base 16).
