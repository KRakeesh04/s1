:::note

I don't like including stuff like these in the curriculum. The trends are
changing quickly. Even within an year, half of the content might become outdated
or false.

Included those for the sake of completeness.

## Current Trends

### Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a subscription-based service which provides a pool of
configurable computer resources: storage, networks, servers, applications, and
services, over the internet.

For an example, suppose a company that wants to have an additional 100 computers
only for a week to process a large set of data. Instead of buying 100 computers,
it can subscribe to a cloud service and use computers at service provider’s end
through the internet during the week. Then they only have to pay for the week
they used those computers. It's cost-effective.

#### Characteristics of cloud computing:

- On demand service: The users can change the service according to their
  requirements. They will be charged according to that.
- Broad network access: Cloud computing resources can be accessed using any
  usual computer over the network.
- Rapid Elasticity: Cloud resources can be provisioned or released at any time
  based on demand, enabling the application to have exact amount of resources
  that it needs.
- Pool of Computing Resources: Service providers serve multiple consumers with a
  pool computing resources by dynamically allocating and de-allocating
  resources.
- Measured Service: Cloud resources usage is monitored and measured by both
  service user and service provider and billed appropriately. Therefore,
  businesses have to pay only for what they use.

Cloud computing can bring some disadvantages: possible downtime, security and
privacy concerns, etc.

### Augmented Reality

Augments / supplements user’s physical, real-world environment with computer
generated sensory inputs such as video, sound, graphics, or location (E.g.: GPS)
data. Users can visualize information about the environment and its objects
which are laid on top the real world.

Applicable for many fields including architecture, art, commerce, education,
gaming, medical, etc.

### Ubiquitous Computing

The concept of enabling computing everywhere at any time. Aka. pervasive
computing.

Examples: smart phones, PDA (Personal Digital Assist), smart glasses, digital
watches, and interactive white boards.

#### Characteristics

- Very tiny in physical size
- Being integrated into any shape of device and displacing services of desktop
  systems
- Augment the original use-value of devices they are embedded
- Communicating through increasing interconnected networks

## Future Trends

### GPU-Accelerated Computing

GPU-accelerated computing is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU)
together with a CPU to accelerate scientific, engineering, and enterprise
applications. Compute-intensive work is offloaded to a GPU while the remaining
work is carried out by CPU. Enables applications to run significantly faster.

### Reconfigurable Computing

Reconfigurable computing is a computer architecture combining some of the
flexibility of software with the high performance of hardware by processing with
very flexible, high speed, computing fabrics like field- programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs).

The principal difference when compared to using ordinary microprocessors is the
ability to make substantial changes to the data path and to the control flow. On
the other hand, the main difference with custom hardware, i.e.,
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is the possibility to adapt the
hardware during runtime by "loading" a new circuit on the reconfigurable fabric.

### Quantum Computing

A quantum computer, aka. a quantum supercomputer, is a computation device that
makes direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and
entanglement, to perform operations on data.

Digital computers require data to be encoded into bits, each of which is always
in one of two definite states 0 or 1, quantum computation uses qubits (quantum
bits), which can be a superposition of states. A theoretical model is the
quantum Turing machine, also known as the universal quantum computer.

Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments
and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop
quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes, such as
cryptanalysis. Large-scale quantum computers will be able to solve certain
problems much more quickly than any classical computer using the best currently
known algorithms.
