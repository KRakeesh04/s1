Non-volatile or permanent. High capacity. Low cost-per-megabyte.

Can be categorized into 3 types (Magnetic storages are included in a separate
page):

- [Magnetic](/programming-fundamentals/magnetic-storage)
- [Optical](#optical)
- Floptical - combination of optical and magnetic devices

## Optical

Uses tiny visible light beams or laser.

Examples:

- Compact Disk - Read Only Memory
- Compact Disk - Recordable
- Compact Disk - ReWritable
- Digital Video Disk
- Digital Video Disk - Recordable
- Digital Video Disk - ReWritable

### Compact Disk

Made of polycarbonate wafer, 120mm in diameter and 1.2mm thick, with a 15mm hole
in the centre.

The wafer base is stamped or moulded with a single physical track in a spiral
configuration starting from the inside of the disk and spiralling outwards. When
examined under a microscope, pits (raised bumps along the track) and lands (flat
areas between the pits) can be seen. Pits are 0 and lands are 1.

Light beam is generated by the photo diode. It is directed through several
prisms. Then the reflecting mirror rotates the light beam by 90°. The servomotor
positions the beam onto the correct track on the CD by moving the reflective
mirror. Then the reflected light from the surface of the CD is sent out through
a focusing lens to the same mirror. Mirror rotates the beam by 90° and it is
sent through a beam splitter (set of prisms). The beam splitter directs the
returning light towards another focusing lens. Then the directed light is
detected by a photo detector (phototransistor) and it will invert the light into
set of electrical impulses. These electrical impulses will indicate whether each
bit is 1 or 0.

## Flash storage

Built using EEPROMs. High capacity and high transfer speed compared to other
forms of portable media. Low latency, low noise, low power consumption, high
reliability.

HDDs are now being replaced with SSDs which uses flash memory technology. RAM
modules are also starting to use flash memory technology.

Categorized into 2 divisions based on operational characteristics:

- NAND Flash
- NOR Flash

Flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from floating
gate transistors. In the traditional flash drives, each cell stores a single bit
of data. However, newer flash devices known as multi- level cell devices can
store more than one bit per cell by choosing between multiple levels of
electrical charge.
