Data types can be grouped into 3 categories.

## Primitive

Data types that are directly supported by a programming languages.

Examples are:

- Boolean
- Characters
- Integers
- Floating-point numbers
- Memory pointers

## Composite

Data types that are built as

- structured collections of primitive types
- using other composite types already defined

Examples are:

- Array
- Record or Tuple
- Union

### Tuple

Represents a finite ordered list of elements. Can contain different data types.
Immutable. Tuple with length n is called as "n-tuple".

Some tuples have special names:

- length 0 : empty-tuple or null-tuple
- length 1 : singleton
- length 2 : couple
- length 3 : triple

## Abstract

Data types that are well defined in terms of properties and operations but not
implementation.

Examples:

- List
- Set
- Stack - Last in; first out
- Queue - First in; first out
- Tree
- Hash Table
- Graph

:::note

Implementations of stacks, queues, and binary search trees are required in s1.

### List

Represents a countable number of values where the same value can occur more than
once. Ordered. Can include different data types. Mutable. Aka. iterable
collection.

Defined methods:

- isEmpty()
- prepend(item)
- append(item)
- head()
- get(i)
- set(i)
- tail()

:::note

Lists in python can be considered as dynamically sized arrays. Methods other
than above-mentioned ones are implemented in python.

### Set

Represents a collection of distinct objects. Unordered. Iterable. Mutable (but
elements must be immutable). No duplicate elements.

### Dictionary

Collection of key-value pairs. Unordered.

### Tree

Holds a set of nodes. Each node holds a value. Each node can have child nodes.

### Binary Tree

Tree with the restriction of at most 2 child nodes per node.

#### Complete Binary Tree

A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely
filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

### Binary Heap

A binary heap is complete binary tree where items are stored in a way such that
the value in a parent node is greater/smaller than values in its 2 children
nodes. Can be represented by a binary tree or an array. 2 types:

- Max heap: when the parent node value is greater than its children nodes
- Min heap: when the parent node value is smaller than its children nodes

Can be represented by either an array or a binary tree.

#### Array representation

If a parent node is stored at index $i$, the left child is stored at index
$2i + 1$ and the right child is stored at index $2i + 2$ (assuming the indexing
starts at 0).

Space efficient representation.
