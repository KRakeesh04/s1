:::note

Programming Fundamentals is probably the less-organized section at the moment.
Let me know how I can improve this.

:::

This module includes 3 sections:

- Programming basics (with python v3.10.9)
- Theories beyond coding
- Hardware

## Important points

### Confusion about unit prefixes

In computing, the prefix _kilo_ —just like other prefixes— has been used to
refer either $2^{10}$ or $10^3$ depending on the context.

- $10^3$ - Marketing of disk capacities (by disk manufacturers)
- $2^{10}$ - Memory capacities, and file sizes, disk capacities by operating
  systems

To avoid this confusion, 2 unit prefixes are used while measuring amounts of
data.

- SI prefixes  
  Defined by ISO. Based on powers of $10^3$. Examples: kilo, mega, giga.
- Binary prefixes  
  Defined by IEC. Based on powers of $2^{10}$. Examples: kibi, mebi, gibi.
