title: Inductors
---

When there is a current in the inductor, a magnetic field is created. Any change
in current causes the magnetic field to change, this in turn induces a voltage
across the inductor that opposes the original change in current.

A length of wire turned into a coil works as a inductor.

## Inductance ($ L $)

For an ideal inductor, the voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of
the current and the polarity is such as to oppose the change in current.

$ v = L \frac{\text{d}i}{\text{d}t} $

Here the $ v $ is the voltage difference between the inductor, and $ i $ is the
current through the inductor.

## Energy stored

Assume voltage across an initially uncharged capacitor rises to $ V $ during a
time period of $ t $seconds.

```math
e = \int_{0}^{t} p dt = \int_{0}^{t} vi dt = L \int_{0}^{i} i di
```

$ E = \frac{1}{2}Li^2 $
