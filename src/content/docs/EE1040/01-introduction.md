An electric power system consists of 3 principle sections

- power stations (generation)
- transmission
- distribution

## Balanced Three-Phase System

In power stations, AC current is generated in 3 different phases. All have the
same max. voltage, but 120 degrees phase difference. At any given time, the
resultant of all 3 phase currents is 0. Hence **balanced**.

## Single-line diagram

A balanced 3-phase circuit can be represented by a single-phase equivalent
circuit. The diagram showing the single-phase equivalent of the power system
using standard symbols.

## Variable load

Load on a power station changes with to uncertain demands of consumers. This is
called the **variable load**.

Load vs time curve is called the **load curve**. Area under this curve is the
**total energy requirement**.

## Charge

- measured in Coulomb ($ C $) = $ 6.25 Ã— 10^{18} $ number of electrons
- quantized
- conserved

Time invariant charge is denoted as $ Q
$. And time varying charge is denoted as
$ q $.

## Current

Time invariant current (DC) is denoted as $ I
$. And time varying current (AC) is denoted as
$ i $.

## Voltage

One volt is the potential difference between two points when one joule of energy
is used to move one coulomb of charge from one point to the other.

$ V = \frac{E}{Q} $

Time invariant voltage is denoted as $ V
$. And time varying voltage is denoted as
$ v $.

## Power

$ p = \frac{\text{d}w}{\text{d}t} = \frac{\text{d}w}{\text{d}q}
\frac{\text{d}q}{\text{d}t} = vi $

## Dimensions & Units

| Current  | $ I $                  | $ A $       |
| Voltage  | $ ML^{2}T^{-2}I^{-1} $ | $ V $       |
| Power    | $ ML^{2}T^{-2} $       | $ Js^{-1} $ |
