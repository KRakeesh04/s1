title: Capacitors
---

Made of two conductive plates separated by an insulating (dielectric) layer.

Capacitance ($ C $), in terms of physical dimensions: $ $

$ C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} $

Here the $ d $ is the distance between the plates, and $ A $ is the area of a
plate.

In an ideal capacitor, the charge imbalance $ Q $ is proportional to the voltage
$ V $ across the plates.

$ Q = CV $

## $ v $ and $ i $

As $ C $ is constant, current $ i $ passing through the capacitor and the
voltage $ v $ across the capacitor are related by:

$ i = C \frac{\text{d}v}{\text{d}t} $

## Energy stored in the capacitor

Assume voltage across an initially uncharged capacitor rises to $ V $ during a
time period of $ t $seconds.

```math
e = \int_{0}^{t} p dt = \int_{0}^{t} vi dt = C \int_{0}^{v} v dv
```

$ E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 $
