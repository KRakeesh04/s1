Inter-molecular bonds: Covalent and Van der Waals or Hydrogen.

## Properties

- Has a repeating structure.
- lightweight
- corrosion-resistent
- easy to process at low temperatures
- generally inexpensive
- generally low in strength
- generally high in toughness
- poor conductors of electricity & heat (= good insulators)

We also have conducting polymers.

## Examples

### Plastics

- Polyvinylchloride (PVC)
- Polyethylene / Polythene (PE)
- Polypropylene (PP)
- Polystyrene (PS)
- Polypropylene - used in kitchen-were
- Polymethylmethacrylite (PMMA) Perspex
- Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Teflon

PMMA Perspex is

- transparent (like glass)
- lightweight
- used in aircrafts' windows & contact lenses.

### Rubber

- Polyisoprene / Natural rubber
- Styrenebutadiene rubber (SBR)
