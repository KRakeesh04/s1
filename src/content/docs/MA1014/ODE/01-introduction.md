title: Introduction to Differential Equations

Equations which are composed of an unknown function and its derivatives.

## Ordinary Differential Equations

When a differential equation involves one independent variable, and one or more
dependent variables.

An example:

$ \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} = \cos(x) $

## Partial Differential Equations

When a differential equation involves more than one independent variables, and
more than one dependent variables.

$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \cos(x) $

## Linear

A linear differential equation is a differential equation that is defined by a
linear polynomial in the unknown function (dependant variable) and its
derivatives, that is an equation of the form:

```math
P_0 (x) y + P_1 (x) y' + ... + P_n (x) y^{(n)} + Q(x) = 0
```

Where

- All (differentiable) functions of x (depends only on x, not on y).
- y and its successive derivatives of the unknown function y of the independent
  variable x.

## Nonlinear

Nonlinear differential equations are any equations that cannot be written in the
above form. In particular, these include all equations that include:

- y and/or its successive derivatives raised to any power (obv. other than 1)
- nonlinear functions of y or any derivative
- any product or function of these

## Order

Highest order derivative.

## Degree

Power of highest order derivative.
