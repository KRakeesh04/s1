## Metals

Pure iron doesn't have any practical use.

Steel (Fe + C) has maximum of 2% C. (won't break easily) (not brittle = ductile)
Cast Iron (Fe + C) has 2%  4% C. (will break easily) (brittle)

Duralamin (Al + Cu)  used for aircraft body (pure Al is not strong enough)

Alloys
 Parent metal (mostly used metal  % wise)
 Alloying elements (other than the parent metal)

Super Alloys
 Too many alloying elements (maybe even 20)

Stiffness directly related to young's modulus. (more is more)
 Steel 200 GPA

Most of engineering requires high stiffness materials
ductile easily change shape by applying force
brittle easily break when applying force

Fe, Co, Ni magnetic (including their alloys)

## Polymers

Generally insulators.
But we have conductingpolymers.

### Examples

Polypropylene  kitchen were
Polymethylmethacrylite PMMA Perspex  transparent (= as glass). lightweight. used in aircrafts' windows, contact lenses.
PTFE (Teflon)

## Ceremics

Highly insulators. There are ceremic magnets.

Behaves like glasses mostly. Brittle as glass.
doesn't mean glass not element of ceremics. Hugely differs in structure. (will explain next week)

### Examples

Sand
Tiles
Cement
Concrete

2 types
Traditional
Advanced

Piezoelectric materials  materials that convert mechanic energy (sound) <> electrical energy (electric current)
Ceremics can also be made to be Superconductors

Some ceremics can survive upto 8K deg C.

## Composites

Plusses of two materials combined together.

### Examples

Concrete (conventional one)
Fiber glass (GFRP)

Fiber glass

combination of glass and plastic
the procedure: glass > fiber (a shape not material) > add plastic == fiber glass
unlike glass  not brittle
