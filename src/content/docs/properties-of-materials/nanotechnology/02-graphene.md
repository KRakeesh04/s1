Carbons arranged to a hexagonal network. 2D crystal based. Has 3 fold symmetry.
Single sheet of graphite.

## Unit Cell

- A rhombus with $120°$.
- Lattice parameter (side length of a unit cell) $a=2d\cos{30}°$ where $d$ is
  the $\text{C}-\text{C}$ bond length.
- 2 atoms per unit cell.

:::note

Single layer of graphene was discovered using scotch tape method and the
discovery won a Nobel prize in 2010.
