## Dielectric material

A material that is electrically insulating (non-metallic) and exhibits (or be
made to) an electric dipole structure.

## Electric Dipole Structure

Electric Dipole Structure is the separation of positive and negative
electrically charged entities on a molecular or atomic level.

:::note

One of the common use cases of dielectric materials is in capacitors.

## Electric Polarization

In dielectric materials, the electric dipoles are aligned in one direction due
to the presence of the electric field. This process of alignment is called
polarization.
