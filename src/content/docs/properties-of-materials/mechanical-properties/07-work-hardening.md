Strength and hardness of a metal increases as a result of plastic deformation.
This process is called work hardening.

Increases:

- strength
- hardness

Decreases:

- ductility
- toughness

## Steps

- Specimen is loaded onto a tensile test apparatus
- Test is stopped after the specimen has gone under plastic deformation
- Specimen is unloaded and reloaded
- New $\sigma-\epsilon$ diagram will have a increased yield strength
