## Observables

- Elastic region
- Yield point
- Proof stress
- Plastic portion
- Steadily decreasing slope
- Ultimate tensile strength
- Localization of the deformation
- Young's modulus
- Upper and lower yield stresses
- Fractural strength

:::note

After yield point, gradient of the stress-strain curve decreases up to the
necking point. This is an indication that the material is becoming stronger and
harder.

:::

### Stiff

Area under the curve, until the yield point. Higher area means the higher
stiffness.

### Strong/strength

- For ductile materials:
  [yield stress](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/definitions/#yield-stress-point)
- For brittle materials: fracture stress

### Flexible

Higher strain in elastic region.

### Weak

Opposite to strengthness.

### Greatest percentage elongation

Maximum strain or failure strain.
