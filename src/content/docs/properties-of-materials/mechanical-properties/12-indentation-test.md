Metal is subjected to indentation with a hard indenter. Depth of the indent is a
measure of hardness.

![Indentation Test](/props/indentation-test.jpg)

Hardness units differ with the type of indenter used and the load applied.

## Units

### Brinell (HB)

- $10\,\text{mm}$ diameter steel / WC ball indenter
- Any load can be applied
- Diameter of the indentation is measured instead of the depth

```math
HB = \frac{2F}{\pi D (D-\sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}
```

Here:

- F - applied load
- D - diameter of the indenter ($10\,\text{mm}$)
- d - diameter of the indentation
- h - depth of the indentation

### Vickers (HV)

- Pyramid shaped indenter made of diamond
- Any load can be applied
- Diagonal lengths $d1$ and $d2$ of the diamond-shape indentation are measured
- Average $d$ is used in the calculation

:::note

Angle between the diamond faces is $136$ degrees. $ $

:::

```math
HV= \frac{1.854\,F}{d^2}
```

### Rockwell (HR)

Not accurate enough to be used in academic level (or where accuracy is
important). Industrially preferred because of ease of measurement.

| Type | Load  | Indenter                                          |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| HRA  | 60kg  | Cone-shaped indenter. Made of diamond.            |
| HRD  | 100kg | Cone-shaped indenter. Made of diamond.            |
| HRC  | 150kg | Cone-shaped indenter. Made of diamond.            |
| HRF  | 60kg  | 1/16” diameter (1.5mm approx.) ball made of steel |
| HRB  | 100kg | 1/16” diameter (1.5mm approx.) ball made of steel |
| HRG  | 150kg | 1/16” diameter (1.5mm approx.) ball made of steel |
| HRE  | 100kg | 1/8” diameter (3mm approx.) ball                  |

:::note

Only 3 load options. No need to remember the above data.
