Ductile materials show brittle behavior as the temperature is lowered. This is
known as ductile-brittle transition.

Ductile-brittle transition behavior of materials is studied by performing impact
test over a range of temperatures.

The transition behavior is:

- Sudden in BCC metals
- Gradual in FCC metals

## Ductile-Brittle Transition Temperature

The temperature which a material is:

- brittle below the temperature
- ductile above the temperature

Many steels exhibit this behaviour.

:::note

Titanic sunk because of this transition.
