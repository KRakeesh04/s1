Materials are categorized into 2, based on the arrangments of atoms or
molecules.

- Crystalline
- Amorphous

## Crystalline

- Ordered arrangment of atoms or molecules.
- Situated in a repeating array over large atomic distances (long-range order).
- Metals and Ceramics.

Atomic arrangement is usually described by **space lattice**.

## Amorphous (or Non Crystalline)

- Random arrangment of atoms or molecules.
- Long-range order is absent.
- Example: Glass.
- Polymers are semi-crystalline.
