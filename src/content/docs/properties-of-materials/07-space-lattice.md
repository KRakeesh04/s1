title: Space Lattice
---

An infinite set of equally-spaced **points** in a space.

Set of lines are used to connect these points to provide a useful guide to the
eye. They are not part of the lattice.

## Unit Cell

Smallest repeating parallelepiped inside the lattice. By stacking in all
directions, the lattice can be generated.

## Crystalline systems

- All crystalline materials fall within one of the 7 possible shapes and 4
  variants.

#### The shapes

Don't have to memorize.

- Cubic
- Hexagonal
- Tetragonal
- Rhombohedral (Trigonal)
- Orthorrhombic
- Monoclinic
- Triclinic

#### The variants

- Simple: atoms at the corners only.
- Base-centered: atoms at the corners and center of 2 opposing sides only.
- Body-centered: atoms at the corners and center only.
- Face-centered: atoms at the corners and center of all faces only.

Bravais showed that only **14** of 28 (7 shapes x 4 variants) are possible in
real life.

TODO: List the 14 here.

We are only going to study about 4 of them.

- Simple cubic (**sc**)
- Body-centered cubic (**bcc**)
- Face-centered cubic (**fcc**)
- Hexagonal close packed or Close packed hexagonal (**hcp/cph**)

## Coordination number (ligancy)

Coordination number of a lattice system is the number of particles that each
particle contacts.
