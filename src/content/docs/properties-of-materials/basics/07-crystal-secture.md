Materials are categorized into 2, based on the arrangement of atoms or
molecules.

- Crystalline
- Amorphous

## Crystalline

When atoms or molecules are arranged in a ordered structure. Long-order is
present.

- Situated in a repeating array over large atomic distances (long-range order).
- Example: Metals and Ceramics.

Atomic arrangement is usually described by
**[space lattice](/properties-of-materials/basics/space-lattice)**.

## Amorphous (or Non Crystalline)

When atoms or molecules are randomly arranged. Long-range order is absent.

- Example: Glass.
- Polymers are semi-crystalline.
