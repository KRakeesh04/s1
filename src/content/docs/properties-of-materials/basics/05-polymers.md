Polymers can be made 100% amorphous but not 100% crystalline.

Inter-molecular bonds: Covalent and Van der Waals or Hydrogen.

## Properties

- Has a repeating structure
- lightweight
- corrosion-resistant
- easy to process at low temperatures
- generally inexpensive
- generally low strength
- generally high toughness
- good heat, electrical insulators (but
  [conductive polymers](/properties-of-materials/electrical-properties/conductive-polymers/)
  exist)

## Examples

### Plastics

- Polyvinylchloride (PVC)
- Polyethylene / Polythene (PE)
- Polypropylene (PP)
- Polystyrene (PS)
- Polypropylene used in kitchen-were
- Polymethylmethacrylite (PMMA) Perspex It's transparent and lightweight. Used
  in aircraft windows and contact lenses.
- Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Teflon

### Rubber

- Polyisoprene / Natural rubber
- Styrenebutadiene rubber (SBR)
