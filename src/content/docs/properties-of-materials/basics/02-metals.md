Metals can be categorized into 2 types.

- Pure metals
- Alloys

## Pure Metals

Inter-molecular bonds: Metallic bonds. Commonly not used in the pure form.

Pure metals might be:

- not strong enough
- too weak to corrosion

## Alloys

Which contain more than one metallic element.

Examples:

- Steel [Fe+C]
- Brass [Cu+Zn]
- Bronze [Cu+Sn]
- Gold jewelry (Au+Cu)
- Duralumin [Al+Cu] - used for aircraft body
- Stainless steel [Fe+C+Cr+Ni],
- Cast iron [Fe+C]

Alloys have a parent metal (mostly used metal, percentage-wise) and one or more
alloying elements (all elements other than parent metal).

:::note[Super Alloys]

Alloys containing too many alloying elements (maybe even 20).

:::note

Steel (Fe + C) has maximum of 2% C. Won't break easily (ductile).  
Cast Iron (Fe + C) has 2%-4% C. Will break easily (brittle).

## Properties

- Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys are magnetic
- Good electrical conductivity
- Good thermal conductivity
- High strength
- High stiffness (= high
  [young's modulus](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/definitions/#youngs-modulus-aka-elastic-modulus))
- Good ductility

:::note

Ductile - easily changes shape by applying force.  
Brittle - easily breaks when applying force.
