## Materials

Materials can be divided into 4 sub-classifications.

- [Metals](/properties-of-materials/basics/metals)
- [Ceramics](/properties-of-materials/basics/ceramics)
- [Polymers](/properties-of-materials/basics/polymers)
- [Composites](/properties-of-materials/basics/composites)

Materials can also be categorized based on their usage or their
[functionalities](/properties-of-materials/basics/functional-materials/).

:::note

Previously wood is considered as a separate classification, along with the
above-mentioned ones.

## Property

A property is the response given by a material to a specific stimulus

- [Mechanical properties](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/introduction)
  – stress
- [Electrical properties](/properties-of-materials/mechanical-properties/introduction)
  – electric field
- Magnetic properties – magnetic field
- Optical properties – electromagnetic or light radiation

## Definitions

### Anisotropic

Different properties in different directions.

### Isotropic

Same properties in all different directions.
