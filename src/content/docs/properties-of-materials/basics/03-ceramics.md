Inter-molecular bonds: covalent and/or ionic.

## Properties

- Non metalics
- Inorganic
- Produced by: shaping => firing.
- High melting temperatures (some can survive upto 8K deg C)
- Low density
- High strength, stiffness, hardness
- Corrosion-resistent
- Generally good insulators (electrical and thermal)
- Brittle as glass. Behaves glass-like mostly.

**Glass is not an element of ceremics**. Hugely differs in structure.

Some ceramic materials are:

- magnetic
- piezoelectric - converts mechanic energy (sound) <> electrical energy
  (electric current)
- superconductors (only few, and only at very low temperatures)

## Examples

- Sand
- Tiles
- Cement
- Concrete

2 types:

- Traditional - clay-based items (like pottery, porcelain, tiles)
- Advanced - (like silicon carbide, boron nitride, zirconia)
