## Bohr theory

Presented by Neil Bohr.

1. Electrons of an atom can have only very distinct energy values. Therefore,
   the electrons are restricted to specific “energy levels” or “stationary
   states”.
2. Electrons in these energy levels rotate about the nucleus in fixed orbits,
   without radiating or absorbing any energy.
3. When an electron receives energy, it moves from a lower to a higher energy
   level.
4. Emission of radiant energy (electromagnetic radiation) is due to the movement
   of the electrons from the higher level to the former lower level of energy.

Bohr Theory **can't** be used to describe the energy characteristics of atoms
containing many electrons. Consequently, in the Modern Atomic Theory, four
quantum numbers were introduced to describe the energy levels

## Quantum numbers

### Principal quantum number

The number given in Bohr’s original stationary states corresponds to the
principal quantum number ($n$). Relates to the distance between the nucleus and
the principal energy levels. $ $

### Secondary quantum number

Represents the various secondary sub-levels within the main energy level and it
relates to the shape of the electron cloud. Denoted by $l$. Values goes from $0$
to $n-1$.

### Magnetic quantum number

Represents the direction of maximum extension in space of the electron cloud in
the sub shells p, d, and f. which has the dumb - bell shape. Denoted by $m$.
Values goes from $-l$ to $l$ (in total $2l + 1$ different values).

### Spin quantum number

Represents the electron spin. +0.5 for clockwise and -0.5 for counterclockwise
spin.

## Principles

### Pauli's exclusion principle

No two electrons in a single atom can have all four-quantum numbers the same.

### Aufbau Principle

Sub-levels with the lowest energy are filled before those with higher energy.

### Hund’s Rule

The sublevels p, d, and f are occupied by single electrons before any pairing of
electrons with opposed spins take place.

## Atomic bonding

### Primary (strong) bonds

Form when valence electrons are present (outer shell not completely filled.

#### Ionic

Forms between highly electropositive elements (metals) and highly
electronegative elements (non-metals). Non-directional.

#### Covalent

Forms within electronegative elements that are close to each other in the
periodic table. Directional.

#### Metallic

Forms in metals. Arrangement of positive ion cores in a sea of electrons.
Non-directional.

### Secondary (weak) bonds

Form when there are no valence electrons (outer shell filled completely).

#### Van Der Waal's

Forms between inert gases and between symmetric molecules. Forms because of the
dipolarity caused inside molecules. Non-directional.

#### Hydrogen

Forms between polar covalently bonded molecules containing H. Polarity is due to
the asymmetry of the molecule. Directional.
