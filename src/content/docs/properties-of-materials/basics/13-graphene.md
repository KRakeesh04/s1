Carbons arranged to a hexagonal network. 2D crystal based.

## Unit Cell

- A rhombus with $120°$.
- Lattice parameter is $2d\cos{30}°$ where $d$ is the $\text{C}-\text{C}$ bond
  length.
- 2 atoms per unit cell.

:::note

Single layer of graphene was discovered using scotch tape method and the
discovery won a Nobel prize in 2010.

## Synthesis

- Top-down approaches
  - Exfoliation (eg: Scotch tape method)
- Bottom-up approaches
  - Chemical vapor deposition

:::note

Graphene has a band gap of $0$.
