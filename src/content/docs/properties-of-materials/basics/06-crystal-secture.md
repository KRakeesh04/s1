Materials are categorized into 2, based on the arrangments of atoms or
molecules.

- Crystalline
- Amorphous

## Crystalline

- Ordered arrangement of atoms or molecules.
- Situated in a repeating array over large atomic distances (long-range order).
- Example: Metals and Ceramics.

Atomic arrangement is usually described by
**[space lattice](/properties-of-materials/basics/space-lattice)**.

## Amorphous (or Non Crystalline)

- Random arrangement of atoms or molecules.
- Long-range order is absent.
- Example: Glass.
- Polymers are semi-crystalline.
