Inter-molecular bonds: Covalent and Van der Waals or Hydrogen.

## Properties

- Has a repeating structure.
- lightweight
- corrosion-resistant
- easy to process at low temperatures
- generally inexpensive
- generally low strength
- generally high toughness
- poor conductors of electricity & heat (= good insulators) (but
  [conductive polymers](/properties-of-materials/electrical-properties/conductive-polymers/)
  exists as well)

## Examples

### Plastics

- Polyvinylchloride (PVC)
- Polyethylene / Polythene (PE)
- Polypropylene (PP)
- Polystyrene (PS)
- Polypropylene - used in kitchen-were
- Polymethylmethacrylite (PMMA) Perspex
- Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Teflon

:::note

PMMA Perspex is

- transparent (like glass)
- lightweight
- used in aircrafts' windows & contact lenses.

:::

### Rubber

- Polyisoprene / Natural rubber
- Styrenebutadiene rubber (SBR)
