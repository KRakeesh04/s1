8 forms:

1. Uniform / General corrosion
2. Galvanic corrosion
3. Crevice corrosion
4. Pitting corrosion
5. Inter-granular corrosion
6. Erosion corrosion
7. Stress corrosion
8. Selective leaching

## Uniform corrosion

Occurs uniformly over the entire exposed area of the metal. Rust forms all over
the surface. Leads to 30% of corrosion failures.

## Galvanic corrosion

When 2 metals are in contact (electrically) and placed in a corrosive
environment, only one metal --the element with most negative potential--
corrodes. Aka. two metal corrosion.

Galvanic corrosion can happen even inside 1 metal. In such cases, one part of
the metal becomes anodic to the rest.

Corrosion will be severe at the junction.

### Area effect

Smaller the anode, severe will be the corrosion.

### Galvanic series

Designed to be an extension of electrochemical series that includes alloys and
non-metals. Materials are ordered in ascending order of reactivity. Materials in
the lower position becomes the anode. Specific for a particular environment.
