### Corrosion

Deterioration of metals due to the reaction with the environment.

All corrosion reactions are electrochemical in nature.

### Electrochemical reactions

Pair of reactions in which electron transfer occurs from one reaction to
another.

#### Oxidation

The reaction where an electron is released. Aka. anodic reaction.

#### Reduction

The reaction where an electron is consumed. Aka. cathodic reaction.

#### Anode

The site at which oxidation takes place.

#### Cathode

The site at which reduction takes place.

### Common reactions

#### Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)

```math
2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \rightarrow H_2
```

#### Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)

```math
O_2 + H_2O + 4e^{-}
\rightarrow 4OH^{-}
```
