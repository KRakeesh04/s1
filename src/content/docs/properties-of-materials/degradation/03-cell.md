When 2 electrodes are electrically connected.

## Cell potential

Absolute difference between the 2 electrode's standard electrode potentials.
Denoted by $\Delta E^0$. $ $

For a corrosion reaction to occur spontaneously, $\Delta E^0 \gt 0$. Cell
potential is an indication of the rate of corrosion. $ $
