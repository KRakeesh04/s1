title: Defects in Crystals
---

There won't be a crystal with 100% of perfect arrangement. Defects are are
advantages in materials most of the time.

1. Point defects
2. Line defects / Dislocations
3. Planar defects
4. Bulk defects - Related to volumetric defects. Common for any materials.
   Example: crack, holes. Not covered.

## Point defects

Related to a single atom.

- Vacany - Missing parent atom
- Self-interstitial atom - A parent atom entered into an interstitial site
- Interstitial impurity atom - A foreign atom entered into an interstitial site
- Substitutional impurity atom - A foreign atom replaced a parent atom or a
  vacancy

## Line defects

Related to a line of atoms. Three types:

- Edge dislocation - only covered in s1
- Screw dislocation
- Mixed dislocation (combination of above 2)

### Edge dislocation

Caused by removal of a half plane.

#### Half plane

#### Slip plane

Plane that is perpendicular to the half plane.

#### Dislocation line

Intersecting line of half plane and slip plane.

## Planar defects

Related to a plane of atoms.

### Grain boundaries

Planar defects found in crystalline materials.
