$\lim_\limits{z\to z_0} f(z) = L$ **iff**: $ $

```math
\forall{\epsilon>0}\;
\exists{\delta>0}\;
\forall{z}\;
(0<|z-z_0|<\delta\implies{|f(z)-L|<\epsilon})
```

## Difference from real functions

For real functions, when considering the limit at a point, we could approach the
point either from the left or from the right.

For complex functions, the point can be approached along any path in the complex
plane. The distance $\lvert z âˆ’ z_0 \rvert$ decreases to $0$.
