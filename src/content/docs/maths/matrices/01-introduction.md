## Types of matrices

### Square matrix

Number of columns equal to number of rows.

:::note[Main diagonals of a square matrix]

Formed by elements having equal subscripts.

:::

### Diagonal matrix

A square matrix whose only non-zero elements are main-diagonal elements. Denoted
by $D$. Subset of triangular matrices. $ $

### Identity matrix or Unit matrix

A diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are all equal to $1$. Denoted by $I$.
Subset of diagonal matrices.

### Zero matrix / Null matrix

All elements are $0$. $ $

### Column matrix (column vector)

Only $1$ column. $ $

### Row matrix (row vector)

Only $1$ row. $ $

### Triangular matrix

Upper triangular matrix or lower triangular matrix.

#### Upper triangular matrix

All elements below the main diagonal are $0$. Subset of square matrices. $ $

#### Lower triangular matrix

All elements above the main diagonal are $0$. Subset of square matrices. $ $

## Matrix operations

### Addition and subtraction

Order of the 2 matrices must be same. Matrix obtained by adding or subtracting
corresponding elements.

### Scalar multiplication

Matrix obtained by multiplying all elements by the scalar.
