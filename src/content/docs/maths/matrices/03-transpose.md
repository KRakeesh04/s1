Matrix obtained from a given matrix by interchanging its rows and columns.
Denoted by a superscript T, like $A^T$. $ $

## Properties

1. $(A^T)^T=A$
2. Distributive over addition: $(A+B)^T=A^T+B^T$
3. $(kA)^T=kA^T$
4. $(A\times B)^T=B^T\times A^T$

## More types of matrices

### Symmetric matrix

If $A=A^{T}$. Subset of square matrices. $ $

### Skew-symmetric matrix

If $A=-A^{T}$. Subset of square matrices. All elements in main diagonal are $0$.

:::note

Any square matrix can be expressed as a sum of a symmetric matrix and a
skew-symmetric matrix.
