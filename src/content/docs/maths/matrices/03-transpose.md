Matrix obtained from a given matrix by interchanging its rows and columns.
Denoted with a superscript T, like $A^T$. $ $

## Properties

- $(A^T)^T=A$
- Distributive over addition: $(A+B)^T=A^T+B^T$
- $(kA)^T=kA^T$
- $(A\times B)^T=B^T\times A^T$
- [Spectrum](/maths/matrices/eigenvalues-eigenvectors/#spectrum) of $A^T$ is
  equal to the spectrum of $A$
- $\big|A^{T}\big|=|A|$
