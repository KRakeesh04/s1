## Theorem I

If $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ that is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and if $g'$ is
integrable on $[a,b]$ then

```math
\int_a^b g' = g(b) - g(a)
```

:::note[Proof Hint]

Consider a general partition and use
[Mean Value Theorem](/maths/real-analysis/other-theorems/#mean-value-theorem) on
each parition.
