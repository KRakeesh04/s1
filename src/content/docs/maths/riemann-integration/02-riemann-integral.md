Let $f\,-\,[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded (not necessarily continuous)
function on a closed, bounded (compact) interval. $ $

Riemann integral of $f$ is: $\int_{a}^{b}{f}$

## Definite integral

When $a,b$ are constants. $ $

## Indefinite integral

When $a$ is a constant but $b$ is replaced with $x$.
