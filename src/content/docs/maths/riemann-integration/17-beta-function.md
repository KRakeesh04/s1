Beta function is defined as below, for $m,n\gt 0$: $ $

```math
B(m,n)=\int_0^1 x^{m-1}(1-x)^{n-1}\,\text{d}x
```

Aka. Eulerian integral of the first kind.

:::note

For $m,n\le 0$, the gamma function is divergent.

## Properties

### Symmetrical

From the definition:

```math
B(m,n) = B(n,m)
```

:::note[Proof Hint]

Proof is trivial.
