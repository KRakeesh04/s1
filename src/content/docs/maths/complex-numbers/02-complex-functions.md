Suppose $w=f(z)$ where $z,w \in \mathbb{C}$. Input and output points are denoted
in 2 separate complex planes.

![Complex function mapping](/maths/complex/complex-function.jpg)

Here:

- $D$ - domain of $f$
- $D'$ - codomain of $f$

### Image

Image of $f$ is the set: $ $

```math
\big\{
f(z)\;|\;z\in D
\big\}
```

## Cartesian form

```math
f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)
```

Here $u, v$ are real functions.
