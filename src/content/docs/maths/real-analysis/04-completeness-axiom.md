Let $A$ be a non empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

- $u$ is the upper bound of $A$ if: $\forall a\in A;a\le u$
- $A$ is bounded above if $A$ has an upper bound
- Maximum element of $A$: $\max{A} = u$ if $u\in A$ and $u$ is an upper bound of
  $A$
- Supremum of $A$ $\sup{A}$, is the smallest upper bound of $A$
- $l$ is the lower bound of $A$ if: $\forall a\in A;a\ge l$
- $A$ is bounded below if $A$ has an lower bound
- Minimum element of $A$: $\min{A} = l$ if $l\in A$ and $l$ is an lower bound of
  $A$
- Infimum of $A$ $\inf{A}$, is the largest lower bound of $A$

## Required proofs

- $sup(a,b)=b$
- $inf(a,b)=a$

## Completeness axioms of $\mathbb{R}$

- Every non empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded above has a supremum
  in $\mathbb{R}$
- Every non empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded below has a infimum in
  $\mathbb{R}$
