```math
\zeta(s) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\frac{1}{k^s}}
```

Convergence of this function can be derived using
[integral test](/maths/real-analysis/convergence-tests/#integral-test). The
above-mentioned series is also referred to as p-series.

This function converges **iff** $s>1$. And it converges to: $ $

```math
\frac{1}{s-1}
```

Otherwise it diverges.
