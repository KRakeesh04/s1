A function $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ is a relation $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ which is
[everywhere defined](/maths/real-analysis/relations/#everywhere-defined) and
[not one-many](/maths/real-analysis/relations/#not-one-many).

- $dom(f)=A=preran(f)$

## Inverse

For a function $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ to have its inverse relation
$f^{-1}:\,B\rightarrow{A}$ be also a function, we need:

- $f$ is [onto](/maths/real-analysis/relations/#onto)
- $f$ is [not many-one](/maths/real-analysis/relations/#not-many-one) (in other
  words, $f$ must be [one-one](/maths/real-analysis/relations/#one-one))

The above statement is true for all unrestricted function $f$ that has an
inverse $f^{-1}$:

$f(f^{-1}(x))=x=f^{-1}(f(x))=x$
