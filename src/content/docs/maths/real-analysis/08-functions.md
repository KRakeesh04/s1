## Definitions

A function $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ is a relation $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ which is
**everywhere defined** and **not one-many**.

### Inverse

For a function $f:\,A\rightarrow{B}$ to have its inverse relation
$f^{-1}:\,B\rightarrow{A}$ be also a function, we need:

- $f$ is onto
- $f$ is **not** many-one (in other words, $f$ must be one-one)

:::note

onto and one-one relation is called a **bijection**.
