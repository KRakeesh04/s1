```math
\zeta(s) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\frac{1}{k^s}}
```

Convergence of this function can be derived using
[integral test](/maths/real-analysis/convergence-tests/#integral-test). The
above-mentioned series is also referred to as p-series.

This function converges **iff** $s>1$. And it converges to: $ $

```math
\frac{1}{s-1}
```

## Extension

The $\zeta$ function can be extended to the set $\mathbb{C}-\set{1}$. $ $

### Ramanujan Sum

```math
\zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12}
```

Which is why, it's used as below:

```math
1+2+3+4+5+\dots = -\frac{1}{12}
```

This is known as the Ramanujan sum of the diverging series.

## Riemann Hypothesis

The $\zeta$ function has its zeros only at negative even integers and complex
numbers with real part $\frac{1}{2}$. $ $

One of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.
