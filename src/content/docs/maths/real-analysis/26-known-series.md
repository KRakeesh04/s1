These series are helpful when using the direct comparison test or limit
comparison test.

### Convergent

When $s \gt 1$: $ $

```math
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^s}
```

The above series is known as p-series (not power series) and occurs in the
definition of
[Riemann zeta function](/maths/real-analysis/riemann-zeta-function).

When $\lvert r \rvert \lt 1$: $ $

```math
\sum_{k=1}^\infty r^k
```

### Divergent

When $s \le 1$: $ $

```math
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^s}
```

When $\lvert r \rvert \ge 1$: $ $

```math
\sum_{k=1}^\infty r^k
```
