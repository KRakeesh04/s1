## Atmospheric Pressure

Pressure exerted by atmospheric air.

## Guage Pressure

Measured in respect to atmospheric pressure.

## Absolute Pressure

Measured in respect to perfect vaccum.

$ \text{Absolute Pressure} = \text{Armospheric Pressure} + \text{Guage Pressure}
$

## Pressure Measurements

### Barometer

### Piezometer

Open-ended tube connected to a vessel / pipe containing a liquid.

Measures the pressure head of a liquid.

#### Advantages

- Simple
- Small pressure differences can be measured

#### Disadvantages

- Only for liquids
- Long tube required to measure even moderate pressures

### Manometer
