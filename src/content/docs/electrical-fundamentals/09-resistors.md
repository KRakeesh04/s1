Resistance, in terms of physical dimensions:

$ R = \frac{\rho l}{A} $

Here the $ l $ is the length, and $ A $ is the cross-sectional area, $ \rho $ is
the resistivity.

If a voltage $ V $ is applied across a conductor, then a given current $ I $
will flow through the conductor $ V \propto I $. The proportionality constant is
called resistance $ R $.

$ R = \frac{V}{I} $
