An electric power system consists of 3 principle sections

- power stations (generation)
- transmission
- distribution

## Balanced Three-Phase System

In power stations, AC current is generated in 3 different phases. All have the
same max. voltage, but 120 degrees phase difference. At any given time, the
resultant of all 3 phase currents is 0. Hence **balanced**.

## Single-line diagram

A balanced 3-phase circuit can be represented by a single-phase equivalent
circuit. The diagram showing the single-phase equivalent of the power system
using standard symbols.

## Variable load

Load on a power station changes with to uncertain demands of consumers. This is
called the **variable load**.

Load vs time curve is called the **load curve**. Area under this curve is the
**total energy requirement**.
