Most domestic installations in Sri Lanka use single phase and is supplied at
230V line to neutral.

Up to the energy meter belongs to the supply authority. Consumer's installation
starts from the main switch.

Final circuits are taken from the consumer unit (or distribution unit).

## Wiring a final circuit

### Loop-in method

![Loop-in method](/electrical/loop-in-method.jpg)

Enables all joints and terminations in a single final circuit to be made at
ceiling roses, switches or other accessories. This makes all joints accessible
for testing and alterations. Each final circuit has both its live and neutral
conductors terminating at the consumer unit. Wires are usually laid in PVC
conduits.

:::note

Lamp circuits do not normally need an earth wire unless there is a metallic
fitting which needs to be earthed for safety.

### Two-way switches

Used when it's necessary to operate an equipment from 2 positions.

## Final circuits for socket outlets

Socket outlets are wired in 2 ways.

### Ring circuit

![Ring circuit](/electrical/ring-circuit.jpg)

Each circuit commences from consumer unit (or distribution board) through an MCB
(or fuse), loops into each socket outlet and returns to the same MCB (or fuse)
in the consumer unit (distribution board).

Looping must be done for the live, neutral and the protective conductors in
separate rings.

A ring circuit can only be used when:

- The floor area served by the ring does not exceed $100\,\text{m}^2$
- Maximum demand of the circuit doesn't exceed the MCB (or fuse) rating

### Radial connection

Each circuit commences from consumer unit (or distribution board) through an MCB
(or fuse), loops into each socket outlet and ends at a socket outlet.
