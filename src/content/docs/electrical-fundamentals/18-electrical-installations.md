An assembly (connected as a complete set) of associated electrical equipment to
fulfill a specific purpose and having certain coordinated characteristics.

### Electrical equipment

Any item used in generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of
electrical energy.

Examples: generators, transformers, measuring instruments, protective devises,
wiring materials, etc.

### Overcurrent

Current that exceeds the rated value. Includes overload and fault current.

### Current carrying capacity

The rated value of current, for conductors.

### Faulty current

Can be subdivided into:

- short-circuit current
- earth fault current

## Most common types of faults

### Short-circuit fault

Large current will flow. Over heating will occur. Damages may occur to wires,
insulators, switches, etc. Aka. phase-neutral fault.

### Insulation failure

Fault between phase conductor and non-current carrying metallic parts. High
voltages may appear on the frames of electrical equipment.

## Protection for safety

Protecting livestock and electrical equipments from electric faults.

- Prevent damage by fire or shock
- Maintain supply continuously
- Minimize the system interruptions under faulty conditions.
- Against direct contact: Relates to live parts.
- Against indirect contact: Relates to exposed parts. Conductive but not
  normally live. Made live by fault.

### Properties of protective equipment

- Certainty and reliability of operation under normal, fault, non-operational
  conditions
- Discrimination
- Rapidity of operation: how fast the equipment responses
- Simplicity
- Low initial and maintenance cost
- Easy adjustment and testing

### Protection methods

- Earthing of equipments
- Use of
  [circuit breakers](/electrical-fundamentals/mcb)/[fuses](/electrical-fundamentals/fuses/)
- Use of [residual current circuit breakers](/electrical-fundamentals/rcd)
