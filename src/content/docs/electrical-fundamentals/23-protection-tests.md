After an electric installation is done, it must be tested for faults, to ensure
the safety of users and electrical appliances.

## Insulation test

To make sure there are no short circuits and the circuit is properly insulated.

### Procedure

1. All main circuit breaker, MCBs, RCCBs are turned off
2. Turn on the required MCB and switch
3. All appliances are unplugged
4. Appropriate scale is set on the tester
5. One probe is connected to the earth bus bar
6. Other probe is connected to the live of the load
7. Circuit is tested
8. If the reading is higher than $1\,\text{M}\Omega$, test is passed

## Continuity test

To check if current passes through 2 points of the circuit continuously.

### Procedure

1. Installation is disconnected by turning off main switches, MCB, RCCB
2. All appliances are unplugged
3. All switches are in on state
4. Appropriate scale is set on the tester
5. One probe is connected to the earth bus bar
6. Other probe is connected to the earth of the socket
7. Circuit is tested
8. If the reading is less than $10\,\Omega$, test is passed
