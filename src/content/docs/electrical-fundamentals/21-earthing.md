An effective earthing system avoids having dangerous potentials on the equipment
even during electrical faults and also ensures the proper operation of
electrical protection equipment during fault condition.

Potential of an installation is measured with respect to earth.

Earthing is done for 2 purposes.

## Neutral Earthing

Limiting the voltage of current carrying conductors forming a part of the
system.

This is important because the performance of the system in terms of short
circuits, stability, protection, etc., is greatly affected by the state of the
neutral conductor. When the neutral is properly grounded, voltages of the phases
are limited to near phase to ground voltage.

## Equipment Earthing

Limiting the potential of non-current carrying metal work associated with
equipment, apparatus and appliances in the system.

Refers to grounding of all non-current carrying metal work of equipment.
Governed by various regulations such as the IEE regulations. The objectives of
this grounding are:

- To ensure effective and rapid operation of the protective gear in the event of
  earth fault currents. Otherwise, those currents might be undetected, cause
  fire
- Protect against danger to life through shock due to installation metal work
  being maintained at a dangerous potential relative to earth

## Types of earthing arrangements

In the regulations for electrical installations, the types of earthing systems
are identified as follows, depending on the relationship of the source (supply
authority network) and of the exposed conductive parts of the installation, to
earth.

- TN - earthing of the installation is done to that supplied by the supply
  authority
- TT - supply authority earth and the installation earth is independent
- IT - supply authority has effectively an isolated neutral and the installation
  has an independent earth

TT system is shown below:

:::note

In domestic systems, the earthing circuit is usually earthed by connecting to
metallic water pipes buried in ground.
