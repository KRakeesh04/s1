An assembly (connected as a complete set) of associated electrical equipment to
fulfill a specific purpose and having certain coordinated characteristics.

### Electrical equipment

any item used in generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of
electrical energy.

Examples: generators, transformers, measuring instruments, protective devises,
wiring materials, etc.

### Overcurrent

Current that exceeds the rated value. Includes overload and fault current.

### Current carrying capacity

The rated value of current, for conductors.

### Fauly current

Can be subdivided into:

- short-circuit current
- earth fault current

## Protection for safety

Protecting livestock from electric shocks.

- Against direct contact: Relates to live parts.
- Against indirect contact: Relates to exposed parts. Conductive but not
  normally live. Made live by fault.

## Protection methods

- Earthing of equipments
- Use of circuit breakers/fuses
- Use of residual current circuit breakers

## Fuses

A device for opening a circuit by means of a conductor designed to melt when an
excessive current flows along it. Simple. Relatively cheap.

When overcurrent flows through a fuse, the fuse element melts and followed by
arcing.

### Fuse element

Part of a fuse. Designed to melt and open the circuit when overcurrent flows.

### Fuse link

Part of a fuse, which comprises a fuse element and a cartridge (or other
container) and is capable of being attached to the fuse contacts.

### Current rating

Maximum current, which the fuse will carry for an indefinite period without
undue deterioration of the fuse element.

### Fusing current

Minimum current that will cause the fuse element to heat up melt or blow.

### Fusing factor

The ratio of the fusing current to current rating.

### Semi-enclosed fuse

Consist of a fuse holder made up of a fuse base and a fuse carrier.

The fuse carrier contains the fuse element usually in wire form. "Rewireable"
because the elements are directly replaceable.

## Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB)

![MCB](/electrical/mcb.jpg)

Has 4 functional components:

- A thermal overload trip (bi-metal)
- An electromagnetic short-circuit trip
- A switching mechanism with contacts
- Arc exhausting system

### Function of the thermal device

![Thermal device of MCB](/electrical/function-of-mcb-thermal.jpg)

The overload trip depends on the operation of the thermally operated bi-metal
strip. When heated by the current passing through, the bi-metal strip is
deflected due to the difference in expansion. The deflection thus depends on the
intensity of heat dependent on the intensity of the current flow and the
duration. As can be seen from the figure, after the deflection (or temperature)
exceeds a predetermined amount, the tripping mechanism is activated

### Function of the EM device

![EM device of MCB](/electrical/function-of-mcb-em.jpg)

Electromagnetic trip consists essentially of a solenoid coil through which the
load current flows. In this coil, there is a fixed iron-core with a movable
armature. When the current exceeds a predetermined value, the coil exerts
sufficient electromagnetic force to attract the armature against the force of
the spring. A switch mechanism is activated by the lever, to open the contacts.

## Residual Current Device (RCD)

![RCD](/electrical/rcd.jpg)

If there is an out of balance, as what happens when part of the current from the
live flows to earth at the fault, an out of balance flux is produced, causing
operation of the relay and opening of the main contacts. Highlight

## Earthing of electrical installations

Can be categorized depending on:

- relationship of the source
- exposed conductive parts of the installation
