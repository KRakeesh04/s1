An electric power system consists of 3 principle sections

- Power stations: electricity is generated
- Transmission: voltage is stepped to high voltage
- Distribution: voltage is stepped down to medium voltage for distribution over
  a relatively small region

## Variable load

Load on a power station changes with to uncertain demands of consumers. This is
called the **variable load**.

Load vs time curve is called the **load curve**. Area under this curve is the
**total energy requirement**.

## Power grid

Nation-wide, massive, geographically distributed system for electrical power
supply network.

## Sri Lankan Voltage Levels

- High voltage $220\text{ kV}$
- Medium voltage $11\text{ kV}$
- Nominal voltage $230\text{ V}$
- Nominal line-to-line $400\text{ V}$
