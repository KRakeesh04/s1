An electric power system consists of 3 principle sections

- Power stations: electricity is generated
- Transmission: voltage is stepped to high voltage
- Distribution: voltage is stepped down to medium voltage for distribution over
  a relatively small region

## Variable load

Load on a power station changes with to uncertain demands of consumers. This is
called the **variable load**.

Load vs time curve is called the **load curve**. Area under this curve is the
**total energy requirement**.

## Power grid

Nation-wide, massive, geographically distributed system for electrical power
supply network.

## Sri Lankan Scenario

### Voltage Levels

- High voltage $132\text{ kV}$ or $220\text{ kV}$
- Medium voltage $11\text{ kV}$ or $33\text{ kV}$
- Nominal voltage $230\text{ V}$
- Nominal line-to-line $400\text{ V}$

### Power sources

Hydro-power is the most used source of energy for electricity.

Public Utilties Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is the economic, technical and
safety regulator of the electricity industry in Sri Lanka.

## Why high voltage transmission?

### Reduction of power losses

```math
P_{\text{loss}} = I^2R
```

Power losses in transmission lines are called "I^2R" losses. To reduce the power
loss, current have to be reduced.

Power generation in the generator is constant. So voltage is increased to reduce
the current.

### Reduce voltage drop

Voltage drop in the transmission lines is proportional to the current flowing
through it.

### Reduction of power transmission cost

To carry higher currents, the transmission lines must have higher cross
sectional area. So reduced current means smaller transmission lines, and reduced
cost.
