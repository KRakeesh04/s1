An electric power system consists of 3 principle sections

- Power stations: electricity is generated
- Transmission: voltage is stepped to high voltage
- Distribution: voltage is stepped down to medium voltage for distribution over
  a relatively small region

## Variable load

Load on a power station changes with to uncertain demands of consumers. This is
called the **variable load**.

Load vs time curve is called the **load curve**. Area under this curve is the
**total energy requirement**.

## Power grid

Nation-wide, massive, geographically distributed system for electrical power
supply network.

## Sri Lankan Scenario

### Voltage Levels

- High voltage $220\text{ kV}$
- Medium voltage $11\text{ kV}$
- Nominal voltage $230\text{ V}$
- Nominal line-to-line $400\text{ V}$

### Power sources

Hydro-power is the most used source of energy for electricity.

Public Utilties Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is the economic, technical and
safety regulator of the electricity industry in Sri Lanka.
