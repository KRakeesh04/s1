Be sure to revise the Electricity unit of G.C.E. (A/L) Physics.

## Charge

- measured in Coulomb ($ C $) = $ 6.25 Ã— 10^{18} $ number of electrons
- quantized
- conserved

Time invariant charge is denoted as $ Q
$. And time varying charge is denoted as
$ q $.

## Current

Amount of charges (in $ C
$) flowing through a point in unit time. Measured in Ampere ($ A $).
Conventional current (opposite to electron flow) flows from positive to negative
potentials.

$ I = \frac{\text{d}Q}{\text{d}t} $

Time invariant current (DC) is denoted as $ I
$. And time varying current (AC) is denoted as
$ i $.

## Voltage

Voltage at a point is the work that must be done against the electric field to
move a unit positive charge from infinity to that point.

One volt is the potential difference between two points when one joule of energy
is used to move one coulomb of charge from one point to the other.

$ V = \frac{E}{Q} $

Time invariant voltage is denoted as $ V
$. And time varying voltage is denoted as
$ v $.

Voltage difference is the work that must be done against the electric field to
move a unit positive charge from one point to another.

$ V\_{AB} = V_A - V_B $

## Electric Circuit

![Different ways to depict circuits](/electrical/types-of-circuits.png)

Types of circuits

- Closed circuit - the electricity flows
- Open circuit - the electricity doesn't flow. current = 0. infinite resistance.
- Short circuit - very large current. 0 resistance.

## Power

$ p = \frac{\text{d}w}{\text{d}t} = \frac{\text{d}w}{\text{d}q}
\frac{\text{d}q}{\text{d}t} = vi $

w = integral of p of dt from t0 to t

w = integral of vi of dt from t0 to t

**Only when $ v $ and $ i $ is constant**, total work done is $ E = vit $.
