After an electric installation is done, it must be tested for faults, to ensure
the safety of users and electrical appliances.

## Insulation test

To make sure there are no short circuits and the circuit is properly insulated.

### Procedure

1. Turn off all main circuit breaker, MCBs, RCCBs
2. Turn on the required MCB and switch
3. Unplug all appliances
4. Set the appropriate scale on the tester
5. Connect one probe to the earth bus bar
6. Connect other probe to the live of the load
7. Test the circuit

If the reading is higher than $1\,\text{M}\Omega$, test is passed. $ $

## Continuity test

To check if current passes through 2 points of the circuit continuously.

### Procedure

1. Turn off main switches, MCBs, RCCBs - to disconnect the installation
2. Unplug all appliances
3. Turn on all switches
4. Set appropriate scale on the tester
5. Connect one probe to the earth bus bar
6. Connect other probe to the earth of the socket
7. Test the circuit

If the reading is less than $10\,\Omega$, test is passed. $ $
