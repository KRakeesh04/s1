## Waveform

Obtained by plotting instantaneous values of a time-varying quantity against
time.

### Periodic Waveform

A pattern repeats after $T$ time. Periodic time is $T$ and frequency $f$ is
$\frac{1}{T}$.

### Alternating Waveform

A waveform that changes in magnitude and direction with time. Is also a periodic
waveform.

### Sinusoidal Waves

Same as $sin\theta$ vs $\theta$ (in rad). Also called sine waves, and sinusoid.

$y=Asin(\omega{t}+\phi)$

When $\phi$ is: $ $

- $\gt{0}$ - the wave is said to be **leading** by $\phi$
- $=0$ - the wave is the **reference**
- $\lt{0}$ - the wave is said to be **lagging** by $\phi$

Sinusoidal voltages are be easily generated using rotating machines.

### Complex Waveforms

Periodic non-sinusoidal waveforms can be split into its fundamental and
harmonics.

#### Fundamental Waveform

$f_0=f_{\text{complex}}$

#### Harmonics

Sine waves with higher frequencies which is a multiple of $f_0$.$ $

```math
f_{\text{harmonic}} =
n\cdot
f_0\;;\,n\in\mathbb{Z}
```

Harmonics are grouped into

- **odd harmonic** when $n$ is odd.
- **even harmonic** when $n$ is even.
