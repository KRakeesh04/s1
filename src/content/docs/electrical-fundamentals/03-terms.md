## Branch

A branch represents a single element, such as a resistor or a battery.

## Node

A node is the point connecting more than 1 branches. Denoted by a dot.

:::note

All points in a circuit that are connected directly by ideal conductors can be
considered to be a single node.

:::

## Two terminal element

An element connected to two nodes. Branches are two terminal elements.

## Loop

A loop is a closed path through a circuit in which no node is encountered more
than once except for the same start/finish node.

## Mesh

A mesh is a loop without having other loops inside it. Subset of loops.
